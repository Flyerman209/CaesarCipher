IN A QUIET VILLAGE BY THE SEA, THERE LIVED A FISHERMAN NAMED TOM.
EVERY MORNING, HE WOULD SET OUT IN HIS SMALL BOAT, CASTING HIS NET INTO THE SPARKLING WATERS.
TOM LOVED THE OCEAN AND ITS MYSTERIES, DREAMING OF THE BIG CATCH THAT WOULD CHANGE HIS LIFE.
ONE DAY, AS HE PULLED IN HIS NET, HE FELT SOMETHING HEAVY.
TO HIS SURPRISE, HE DISCOVERED A SHIMMERING FISH THAT SPOKE, "RELEASE ME,
AND I WILL GRANT YOU THREE WISHES."
TOM WAS ASTONISHED BUT QUICKLY REALIZED THE POTENTIAL OF SUCH AN OFFER. AFTER SOME THOUGHT,
HE WISHED FOR GOOD FORTUNE, A HEALTHY FAMILY, AND ENDLESS ADVENTURES AT SEA. WITH A SPLASH,
THE FISH GRANTED HIS WISHES, AND FROM THAT DAY ON, TOM'S LIFE WAS FILLED WITH JOY AND EXCITEMENT,
REMINDING HIM OF THE MAGIC THAT LIES BENEATH THE WAVES.
